## Graduation thesis

This project was made at the end of our education. We had to come up with an idea for a platform and this had to be approved by the teachers. The idea came from Stijn and Yoshi and me joined his team, to create the idea.

The idea was to create a platform for neighbours. You all know how busy people are, now a days. When they come home from work, the workday isn't over yet: Dinner needs to be made, the lawn needs to mowed, groceries need to be done, dishes are dirty, ...

So we thought, maybe some neighbours have more time, and they could maybe help, for a small fee.
The platform gives the opportunity to make tasks and to show them to the neighbourhood, others can execute these tasks, and get a fee, with an build-in pay system (Stripe).

1 neighbourhood has a diameter of 2 km, and is base on the google maps api.
